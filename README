Telegram bot organizer

At the start, it is a simple reminder of the tasks stored in the JSON.

Planned for the future:
Adding/removing tasks from a bot
Connect database to store users and tasks
Storing sessions to continue working after restarting the script

The project is implemented in Python 3.10 using the python-telegram-bot 13.14 library
